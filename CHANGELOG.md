ChangeLog
========

[0.3.0] - 2024-07-29
--------

### Added
- â˜… Won't lost packs when next time you update Hot Node (But before uninstalling, exporting all packs is still safer).
- Packs will be auto saved to system's TEMP folder when opening & closing blender, and can be recovered via ```Recover``` button.

### Changed
- Some UI grayed-out logic.

### Removed
- Removed CHANGELOG & README file in the add-on package. You can still find them on Hot Node's github repository.

### Fixed
- Fixed: When exporting all packs, if the directory exists a re-named pack.zip, our unique pack.001.zip will be empty. Now it won't be empty.


[0.2.1] - 2024-07-29
--------

### Fixed
- Now error info won't appear on console when selecting a pack.


[0.2.0] - 2024-07-25
--------

### Added
- Shift + A menu is now supported, use it just like adding a single node!
- Quick preset creation added to the Shift + A menu.
- Export all packs suppported.

### Changed
- When press ```Apply``` on the side bar, the newly created nodes will attach to the mouse for moving, rather than stay in a fixed location. 

### Fixed
- Node frames perform well now.
- Removed some useless console info.


[0.1.0] - 2024-07-17
--------

### Added
- Save node presets and keep them update across any .blend files in real-time.
- Load image by automaticlly seraching and set their color-space & alpha mode.
- Share nodes light-weightly without a big .blend file as it's library (usually a preset pack is smaller than 1 MiB).

### Security
- This add-on is currently in **beta**. For now it's safer not to join it into your important project workflow.
- Undo of Create, Save, Delete operations haven't been supported yet. For now you can turn on the Extra Comformation option in Node Preset Specials menu to prevent misoperation.
- If have ```NodeFrame``` as node's parent, the frame's ```location``` will be unpredictable.
- if have nested ```NodeFrame```, when first created and with auto create select, dragging will make them dance crazily. for now the solution is clicking some where then select them again...
