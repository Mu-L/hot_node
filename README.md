### More...
Hot Node features are easy to discover and understant, you can discover by your self. 

E.g. you can save nodes via context menu (right-click menu), import and export nodes pack, set node tree reuse mode, and disable the extend menu in preferences to have a orginal blender menu. etc. 

## Development

### Nodes Support
Hot Node has an code architecture with a relatively high degree of decoupling. It naturally supported some third-party nodes but does not guarantee 100% accuracy. 

You can add support for nodes and make adaptations for the new version of Blender by editing the module `core.serialization`, typically the `stg.py` and `adaptor.py` of each sub module. See [Blender Python API: bpy.types.Node](https://docs.blender.org/api/5.0/bpy.types.Node.html#bpy.types.Node) also.

### Add Translations
Hot Node uses `translations.csv` under `dev.tools` to store translations. You can add your language to it. See [Blender Locale Definiation](https://projects.staging.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/locale/languages) also.

## Donate
Hot Node is a free add-on, you can donate via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/trantor) or [Áà±ÂèëÁîµ](https://afdian.com/a/trantor). It takes us a lot of time to develop. Your support really makes a difference.
